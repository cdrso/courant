# TODO List

## Research Stage

- [ ]  Revisit Fluid Mechanics notes from university
- [ ]  Revisit CFD notes from university
- [ ]  Revisit Numeric Analysis notes from university
- [ ]  Research how mesh files are constructed and the most popular FOSS formats (gmsh)
- [ ]  Research popular visualization tools (paraview using VTK)
- [ ]  Research how to store the simulation results
- [ ]  Choose an initial solver to implement

## Development Stage

### Get it working

- [ ] Implement mesh file parser
- [ ] Implement simple solver
- [ ] Solve simplest case and be able to visualize it on paraview
